*Put your telephone away*

## Overview

We wanted to help student growing the habit to be more productive by creating a new way to fight procrastination. We have thought about the simplest way and defined what we want. So we started building PYTA: Put Your Telephone Away.

## How it works

PYTA aims to create a physical barrier between you and what disturbs your life, hijacking your thoughts and concentration. PYTA is a box where you can put things you don't want to be bothered from (stop eating cookies, stop waiting for messages) and they will be put out of your world for the time you set on the timer when closing the box. PYTA isn't a question of working more, it is a question of always giving out your best.

## What have we achieved so far

PYTA1 is the first prototype done, based on told above concepts. It is a wooden box with components soldered on the lid controlled with an arduino pro mini and fixed with 3d printed parts.
